## 🔧 Prompt Selection Logic

The system uses intelligent prompt selection based on keyword detection:

```javascript
function createSpecializedPrompt(message) {
  const lowerMessage = message.toLowerCase();
  
  // Check for greeting (but not if it contains analysis keywords)
  if ((lowerMessage.includes('hello') || lowerMessage.includes('hi') || 
       lowerMessage.includes('how are you') || lowerMessage.includes('good morning') ||
       lowerMessage.includes('good afternoon') || lowerMessage.includes('good evening')) &&
      !lowerMessage.includes('analyze') && !lowerMessage.includes('check') && 
      !lowerMessage.includes('investigate')) {
    return 'greeting';
  }
  
  // Check for IP analysis
  if (lowerMessage.includes('ip') || lowerMessage.includes('address') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('192.168') || lowerMessage.includes('10.') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('172.') || /^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$/.test(message)) {
    return 'ip';
  }
  
  // Check for domain analysis
  if (lowerMessage.includes('domain') || lowerMessage.includes('website') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('url') || lowerMessage.includes('.com') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('.org') || lowerMessage.includes('.net')) {
    return 'domain';
  }
  
  // Check for malware/hash analysis
  if (lowerMessage.includes('hash') || lowerMessage.includes('md5') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('sha1') || lowerMessage.includes('sha256') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('malware') || lowerMessage.includes('virus')) {
    return 'malware';
  }
  
  // Check for incident response
  if (lowerMessage.includes('incident') || lowerMessage.includes('breach') ||
      lowerMessage.includes('attack') || lowerMessage.includes('response') ||
